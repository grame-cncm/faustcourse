# Session 2
Welcome to this new session in which you will learn in deepth how the Faust programming language works. 

In the previous session you have seen some code examples includind a simple occarina made by using some predefined functions of the standard Faust Libraries.

In this session we will go into more details and learn both the _syntax_ and the _semantics_ of Faust.

Because many notions are mutually dependend there is no linear way to teach Faust. We will therefore use a kind of spiral approach so that you will always have the big picture in front of you. 

## syntax and semantics
_Syntax_ and _Semantics_ are two important notions when learning any programming language. The _syntax_ tells you how to write well formed programs. The _semantics_ tells you the "meaning" of these programs.

In the case of Faust, you can think of a program as a kind of electronic circuit that computes audio signals. The syntax will tell you how to build the circuit from elementary building blocks. The semantics will tell you what the circuit computes. 

To build a circuit you start form elementary building blocks that are predefined in the language, for example _arithmetic operations_ like `*` or `+`, and you combine them to create more complex circuits.



## definitions

before we go deaper into the syntax and the semantivcs of Faust  

 that takes input signals and produces output signals. The 

The syntax of Faust is quite simple. You start form elementary building blocks, for example _numbers_ like `3.14159` or `0`, _arithmetic operations_ like `*` or `+`, and you combine them to create more complex program.
