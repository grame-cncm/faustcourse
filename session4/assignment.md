# Session 4 - Assignment

## Ideas

* Karplus: do something around guitar/harp, implement strings in parallel and
strum them with a slider. Work to do around built-in lowpass: tune each string
to make them sound better in this context.
* A hard one could be to modify the granular example to fit the recording 
duration to the time the record button is pressed but that might tough. We
could walk them through though... Could do an exercise on using sAndH for
example.
