# Session 5 - Assignment

## Exercise 1: PD Externals

Turn the harp that you made in your Session 3 assignment into a PD external.
Then choose one of the effects from `demos.lib` and turn it also into a PD
external.

Call these 2 externals in a PD patch and connect the harp to the effect. 

Submit a screenshot of your patch/the patch itself. (TODO)

NOTE: alternatively, this exercise could be done in Max/MSP. 

## Exercise 2: SmartKeyboard Looper

Use the looper/granulator from Session 4 to make a mobile app with 
`faust2smartkeyb`. This app should work in a similar way than `toy.dsp` 
(i.e., its interface shouldn't be an actual keyboard and sound should 
being computed when the app is launched).

Experiment with different accelerometer, gyroscope, touchscreen mappings to
make your instrument as expressive as possible.

Make a video of yourself playing your instrument and submit a link to this
video.
