# Session 3 - Assignment

## Ideas

* May be just make a very large plug-in merging all the synthesis techniques
studied during the session? -> Big ass synth?
* Subtractive synthesis: experiment with other types of filters, try to combine
them, may be give a list? Add more LFOs, etc.
* For FM, do something around the DX7: implement FM patches add envelopes to
parameters, etc.
